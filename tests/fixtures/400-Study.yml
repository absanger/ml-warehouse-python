  abstract: This project would establish a collaboration with Stephen Bentley in WTSI
    pathogens and Diederik van de Beek at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam
    to study host and pathogen genomes in bacterial meningitis. All dutch cases of
    this very rare and deadly infection is uniformly referred to a single center in
    Holland, which has collected matched patient/pathogen DNA from 1000 individuals.
    It marks an important opportunity to engage in host-pathogen genomics, as it is
    a cohesive and homogenous collection of infected individuals. We propose to run
    Omni Express chips to study 1000 host genomes in comparison to public Dutch controls
    as well as to do host-pathogen interaction screens and run within-case association
    tests on clinical outcome data. The funding for this project will be joint between
    the Dutch collaborators and Sanger (HumGen funds ~500 samples), it will begin
    a valuable within-Sanger collaboration, and samples are available immediately
    (the collaborators are very keen) enabling spend this FY.

    \ undertaken, which will provide unparalleled power to identify the genetic factors\r\
    \nassociated with the response to all of the most commonly used childhood vaccines\r\
    \nworldwide. For the first phase of the project we genotyped ca. 1,400 children\r\
    \nfrom the Entebbe Mother and Baby (EMaB) study, an ongoing birth cohort in southern\
    \ Uganda, using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-8 chip. Analyses for response to vaccination\r\
    \nagainst diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, measles, hepatitis\
    \ B and BCG are now underway. Working alongside other ongoing studies, we plan\
    \ for the second phase\r\nof the project to expand sample sizes to up to 7,000\
    \ individuals in total. This large cohort will include 1,500 South African infants,\
    \ 500 Burkina Faso infants, 1,800 children from Ecuador\r\nand up to 1,800 from\
    \ a variety of countries (MAL-ED Consortium). The principal measured phenotypes\
    \ will be the serological responses at 6 or 12 months of age to the vaccines\r\
    \nadministered to all enrolled children as part of expanded programme of immunisation\
    \ in all countries. As for the primary Ugandan study the responses will be analysed\
    \ as quantitative\r\ntraits using mixed model (GEMMA) analyses following imputation\
    \ using a combined 1000 Genome and African Genome Variation Project reference\
    \ panel. The data will be analysed as one large discovery mega-analysis to maximise\
    \ the power of finding the relevant associated\r\nvariants. Interim GWAS analyses\
    \ will be performed on each population to test for population specific signals.\
    \ Other phenotypes that will be assessed in the new studies include quantitative\
    \ response to BCG, rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines (South Africa, Ecuador\
    \ and Uganda), clinical and immunological response to malaria vaccines (Burkina),\
    \ immunological correlates of atopy (Ecuador and Uganda) and malaria infection\
    \ (Burkina,\r\nEcuador and Uganda) in addition to non-communicable disease traits\

  abstract: 'Thousands of babies are born each year in the UK who fail to develop
    normally because of errors in their genetic makeup.  Currently, diagnosis is restricted
    to a small minority of children and requires the clinician to recognise the appearance
    of the child and the pattern of symptoms, supplemented by the use of microscopes
    to identify large rearrangements of the genetic material in chromosomes.  Research
    shows that the latest molecular testing methods identify previously undetectable
    changes in chromosomes allowing new diagnoses to be made.   However, clinical
    use is hampered by the limited availability and inconsistent application of these
    technologies, and by lack of basic knowledge to link genetic changes directly
    to symptoms.  The consequence is that clinical diagnoses remain impossible except
    for a small number of children. '

  abstract: Melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer, causing about 75%
    of dermatological cancer deaths. Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is the most
    common subtype of melanoma in admixed Latin American populations, but very few
    tumour genomes and exomes, all from European-descent individuals, have been analysed
    across several studies. Because of this, the genomic landscape of ALM is mostly
    unknown. Our aim in this project is to define this landscape and identify driver
    somatic alterations by whole-exome sequencing a collection of ALM germline/tumour
    paired FFPE samples from the National Cancer Institute of Mexico.

  abstract: "DNA in all cells is prone to mutagenesis, with somatic mutations making\
    \ key contributions to various human diseases such as cancer, and to aging itself.\
    \ Mutations may be the consequence of exogenous or endogenous mutagenic influences\
    \ (including radiations and DNA-damaging chemicals), and also result from the\
    \ intrinsic infidelity of DNA replication or enzymatic DNA modifications. Somatic\
    \ mutations are generally mitigated by the cellular DNA repair machinery, and\
    \ defective functioning of components of this machinery can markedly increase\
    \ mutation rates. Different mutational processes leave different, characteristic\
    \ signatures of somatic mutations on the exposed cellular genome. Notably, recent\
    \ analyses of cancer genomes have revealed several novel mutational signatures,\
    \ the biological bases of which are predominantly unknown. To generally elucidate\
    \ somatic mutational processes operative in cells, in particular their influences\
    \ on human disease, we propose to systematically survey the mutational signatures\
    \ generated by exposures to known DNA damaging agents and defective DNA repair/editing\
    \ processes. These studies will provide a series of mutational signatures with\
    \ known underlying causes for subsequent matching to signatures found in normal\
    \ or diseased human cells, and will explore how various cellular components influence\
    \ mutagenesis. A \u201Cmutational signature\u201D is the pattern of mutations\
    \ occurring as a consequence of unfaithful DNA replication, or as a result of\
    \ an exposure to an endogenous or environmental mutagen. Mutational signatures\
    \ include one or more classes of DNA change; base substitutions, insertions and\
    \ deletions, rearrangements and copy number changes. They can be given extra discriminatory\
    \ power by further characterisation of each mutation class; for example, for base\
    \ substitutions, by incorporating the subclass, the sequence context, the transcriptional\
    \ strand, evidence of substitution clustering (kataegis) and other features relating\
    \ to the genomic or epigenomic landscape. Mutational signatures extracted in this\
    \ proposal will all be characterised by next generation sequencing of whole genomes\
    \ of cell clones that have been exposed to a mutational process caused by DNA\
    \ damaging agents or abnormalities in DNA repair/editing. "

    of interest will be selected, subcloned over a defined period of time and their
    exomes sequenced. The increased load of the mutations representative of a specific
    mutational signature within the genome of a subclone when compared to its parental
    clone will be informative of the on-going mutational processes. To further confirm
    our observation from the exome-sequencing pilot project, whole genomes from parental
    clones and subclones of the cell lines with potentially on-going mutational processes
    will be sequenced. '

  abstract: "DNA in all cells is prone to mutagenesis, with somatic mutations making\
    \ key contributions to various human diseases such as cancer, and to aging itself.\
    \ Mutations may be the consequence of exogenous or endogenous mutagenic influences\
    \ (including radiations and DNA-damaging chemicals), and also result from the\
    \ intrinsic infidelity of DNA replication or enzymatic DNA modifications. Somatic\
    \ mutations are generally mitigated by the cellular DNA repair machinery, and\
    \ defective functioning of components of this machinery can markedly increase\
    \ mutation rates. Different mutational processes leave different, characteristic\
    \ signatures of somatic mutations on the exposed cellular genome. Notably, recent\
    \ analyses of cancer genomes have revealed several novel mutational signatures,\
    \ the biological bases of which are predominantly unknown. To generally elucidate\
    \ somatic mutational processes operative in cells, in particular their influences\
    \ on human disease, we propose to systematically survey the mutational signatures\
    \ generated by exposures to known DNA damaging agents and defective DNA repair/editing\
    \ processes. These studies will provide a series of mutational signatures with\
    \ known underlying causes for subsequent matching to signatures found in normal\
    \ or diseased human cells, and will explore how various cellular components influence\
    \ mutagenesis. A \u201Cmutational signature\u201D is the pattern of mutations\
    \ occurring as a consequence of unfaithful DNA replication, or as a result of\
    \ an exposure to an endogenous or environmental mutagen. Mutational signatures\
    \ include one or more classes of DNA change; base substitutions, insertions and\
    \ deletions, rearrangements and copy number changes. They can be given extra discriminatory\
    \ power by further characterisation of each mutation class; for example, for base\
    \ substitutions, by incorporating the subclass, the sequence context, the transcriptional\
    \ strand, evidence of substitution clustering (kataegis) and other features relating\
    \ to the genomic or epigenomic landscape. Mutational signatures extracted in this\
    \ proposal will all be characterised by next generation sequencing of whole genomes\
    \ of cell clones that have been exposed to a mutational process caused by DNA\
    \ damaging agents or abnormalities in DNA repair/editing. "

  abstract: "Recent advances in genomics have demonstrated that clonal haemopoiesis\
    \ driven by leukaemia associated somatic mutations is a relatively common phenomenon\
    \ that increases in frequency with advancing age. Whilst individuals with clonal\
    \ haemopoiesis have an increased risk of developing haematological malignancies,\
    \ they also have an increased mortality from other causes. Additionally, certain\
    \ mutations are almost exclusively seen in individuals aged 70 years or older,\
    \ whilst others are seen in individuals with non-haematological cancers including\
    \ breast and ovarian. Recently, clonal haemopoiesis was found to be associated\
    \ with a significantly increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\
    \ This association is thought to be causative with clonally-derived macrophages\
    \ showing elevated expression of several chemokine and cytokine genes that contribute\
    \ to atherosclerosis. \r\nAnother vascular pathology, abdominal aortic aneurysm\
    \ (AAA), increases with age and shares risk factors with atherosclerosis (including\
    \ smoking, male sex, high cholesterol). However, the impact of these risk factors\
    \ and the overlap between AAA and atherosclerosis is poorly understood. To investigate\
    \ a possible link between clonal haemopoiesis and AAA, we will study DNA samples\
    \ from 300 patients with AAA and up to 200 controls for evidence of clonal haemopoiesis.\
    \ This will be done using target DNA enrichment with biotinylated RNA baits followed\

  abstract: Recent studies on mutational signatures in cancer genomes identified specific
    patterns of mutations (namely, signatures 2 and 13), which appear in more than
    50% of the cancer types and reflect patterns of mutations caused by family of
    APOBEC cytidine deaminases in the setting of viral and retroviral restriction.
    Here, we set to determine whether APOBEC enzymes are indeed underlying causes
    of mutational signatures 2 and 13, by knocking-out individual APOBEC genes in
    human cancer cell lines which continue to acquire relevant signatures over time
    in vitro.
